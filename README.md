The goverence system in Dungeons and Dragons can be built using Ethereum and Solidity Smart contract. Much of the Dungeons and Dragons
system of governing plays is mirrored in a system called a DAO. A DAO consists of a president (Dungeon Master) with it's own set 
of functions and permissions and the Congress (DnD Players) who have power but are restricted to certain functions and actions.
